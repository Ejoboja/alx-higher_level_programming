README for 0x04 Python - More Data Structures
This repository contains solutions to various tasks focused on advanced data structures and their manipulation in Python. Each task addresses specific functions that operate on dictionaries, sets, lists, and matrices.

File Overview
0-square_matrix_simple.py: Function to compute the square value of all integers of a matrix without modifying the initial matrix.
1-search_replace.py: Function to replace all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
2-uniq_add.py: Function to add all unique integers in a list, considering each integer only once.
3-common_elements.py: Function to return a set of common elements between two sets.
4-only_diff_elements.py: Function to return a set of elements present in only one set.
5-number_keys.py: Function to return the number of keys in a dictionary.
6-print_sorted_dictionary.py: Function to print a dictionary by ordered keys.
7-update_dictionary.py: Function to replace or add key/value pairs in a dictionary.
8-simple_delete.py: Function to delete a key in a dictionary.
9-multiply_by_2.py: Function to return a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
10-best_score.py: Function to return a key with the biggest integer value in a dictionary.
11-multiply_list_map.py: Function to return a list with all values multiplied by a number without using loops.
12-roman_to_int.py: Function to convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
100-weight_average.py: Function to return the weighted average of integers in tuples.
101-square_matrix_map.py: Function to compute the square value of all integers of a matrix using map.
102-complex_delete.py: Function to delete keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
103-python.c: C functions that print basic info about Python lists and bytes objects.
