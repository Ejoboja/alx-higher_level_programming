Python Input/Output
Overview
This project focuses on handling input/output operations in Python. It covers file reading, writing, JSON serialization, and object manipulation.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand the basics of Python's input/output functionality
Read and write text files
Perform JSON serialization and deserialization
Manipulate Python objects for file storage and retrieval
Requirements
Python Scripts
Use Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Use specific editors: vi, vim, emacs
Ensure code adheres to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All Python files must be executable
