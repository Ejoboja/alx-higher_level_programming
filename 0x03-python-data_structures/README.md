Tasks README

0. Print a list of integers
Write a function print_list_integer(my_list=[]) that prints integers from a list, one per line.

1. Secure access to an element in a list
Create a function element_at(my_list, idx) that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

2. Replace element
Define replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element) to replace an element at a specific position in a list.

3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
Write print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]) to print integers from a list in reverse order.

4. Replace in a copy
Implement new_in_list(my_list, idx, element) to replace an element in a list without modifying the original list.

5. Can you C me now?
Create no_c(my_string) to remove all 'c' and 'C' characters from a string.

6. Lists of lists = Matrix
Develop print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]) to print a matrix of integers.

7. Tuples addition
Define add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()) to add integers from two tuples.

8. More returns!
Implement multiple_returns(sentence) to return length and first character of a string.

9. Find the max
Write max_integer(my_list=[]) to find the largest integer in a list.

10. Only by 2
Create divisible_by_2(my_list=[]) to find multiples of 2 in a list.

11. Delete at
Develop delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0) to delete an item at a specific position in a list.

12. Switch
Modify code to switch values of 'a' and 'b' in a few lines of code.

13. Linked list palindrome
Write a C function is_palindrome(listint_t **head) to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

14. CPython #0: Python lists
Create a C function print_python_list_info(PyObject *p) that prints basic info about Python lists.


The provided tasks encompass various Python list manipulation challenges, from basic element access and replacement to reversing lists and handling tuples. Additionally, there are opportunities to explore CPython's underpinnings, such as linked list analysis and understanding Python lists through C functions. These exercises offer a comprehensive exploration of list operations and Python-C interoperability.
