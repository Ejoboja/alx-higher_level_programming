Python Hello World

Python is a high-level, user-friendly programming language renowned for its simplicity and readability. Developed by Guido van Rossum in theearly '90s, Python boasts a clean syntax that prioritizes human readability, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers. Its versatility spans across web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more, supported by an extensive standard library. Python's interpreted nature allows for quick prototyping and seamless integration, contributing to its widespread adoption among programmers worldwide.

The "Python Hello World" tasks project encompasses Python and shell scripting challenges, tackling fundamental concepts from running scriptsto string manipulation and even low-level C programming integration.

Task 0: Run Python File
File: 0-run

A shell script executes a Python script specified in the environment variable $PYFILE. The script's contents are printed to the console.

Task 1: Run Inline
File: 1-run_inline

Another shell script executes Python code saved in the environment variable $PYCODE. The script evaluates the Python code and displays the output.

Task 2: Hello, print
File: 2-print.py

A Python script prints the message "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a newline using the print() function.

Task 3: Print integer
File: 3-print_number.py

A Python script prints an integer variable number followed by "Battery street" and a newline. F-strings are used to format the output.

Task 4: Print float
File: 4-print_float.py

A Python script prints a float variable number with a precision of 2 digits, followed by a newline, using f-strings.

Task 5: Print string
File: 5-print_string.py

The script prints the string variable str three times followed by the first 9 characters of str, separated by a newline, without using loops or conditionals.

Task 6: Play with strings
File: 6-concat.py

A Python script prints the concatenated strings stored in str1 and str2, resulting in "Welcome to Holberton School!".

Task 7: Copy - Cut - Paste
File: 7-edges.py

The script manipulates a string variable word to extract substrings (word_first_3, word_last_2, middle_word) without using loops or conditionals.

Task 8: Create a new sentence
File: 8-concat_edges.py

The script concatenates substrings from the variable str to form the sentence "object-oriented programming with Python".

Task 9: Easter Egg
File: 9-easter_egg.py

A Python script prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, providing insights and guiding principles for Python programming.

Task 10: Linked list cycle
Files: 10-check_cycle.c, lists.h

A C function check_cycle checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it, returning 0 for no cycle and 1 for a cycle.

Task 11: Hello, write
File: 100-write.py

A Python script prints a specific message to stderr without using print() and exits with a status code of 1.

Task 12: Compile
File: 101-compile

A script compiles a Python script file, with the filename stored in the environment variable $PYFILE. The compiled output file has the .pyc extension.

Task 13: ByteCode -> Python #1
File: 102-magic_calculation.py

A Python function magic_calculation(a, b) is implemented to replicate specific bytecode operations.

This repository includes solutions to tasks focusing on Python script execution, string manipulation, bytecode understanding, and C programming related to linked lists. Feel free to explore each task for detailed implementations and solutions!
